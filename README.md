This program is capable with all Arduino / ESP32 / RP2040 / STM32 boards.

The program uses a simple algorithm which I learned from some Python book.

1. Check if the AI can win in one move.
2. Check if the player can win in one move.
3. Choose an empty corner.
4. Choose an empty side.
5. Choose the center.
